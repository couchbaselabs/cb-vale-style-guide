= Task Walkthrough Guides

Use the following guidance to write text for a Task Walkthrough Guide. 

A Task Walkthrough takes a user through a series of steps to complete a specific task in the UI: 

image::walkthrough-guide.png["The Task Walkthrough Guide template from the Pendo Designer. The top of the dialog has the template text 'STEP X OF Y'. The title is 'Target/Task name'. The body text states 'Provide a brief instruction or explanation about this step or feature in the walkthrough. What can the user do or achieve with this?' The bottom of the dialog contains the standard Next and Back buttons.",align=center]

== Progress Tracker 

Every Task Walkthrough Guide should contain a progress tracker at the top of the Guide dialog. 

TIP: Finalize the progress tracker when you're finished designing the rest of your guide. 

Fill in the template with the step number the user is currently on, out of the total number of steps, for each step:
