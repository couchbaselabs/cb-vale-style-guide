= Contractions 

Contractions are combinations of at least two words. 
A contraction is made by omitting one or more letters from one word and adding it to the end of another word. 

Many contractions combine a verb and a pronoun. 


== Don't Use Negative Contractions 

Don't use negative contractions, especially in warning or error messages. 

Any `verb + not` combination should be written out in full. 

For example, do not shorten `could not` to `couldn't`.


== Don't Use Complex Contractions 

Don't use complex contractions like: 

* could've 
* might've 
* must've 
* should've
* would've
