# Please, Thank You and Sorry

Only use "please" if you're asking the user to do something that inconveniences them.
In general, you can reword the error message to avoid "please."

For example, `An unexpected error has occurred. Please reupload your file and try again.` or `An unexpected error has occurred. Reupload your file and try again.`

Don't use "thanks" or "thank you."
