= Headings 

Headings are text components that mark off areas of xref:instruction-text.adoc[] or other interactive components in the UI. 

To write headings in UI copy: 

* <<sentence,>>
* <<punctuation,>>

[#sentence]
== Use Sentence Case 

Write headings in sentence case.
Capitalize proper nouns or other terms that are capitalized elsewhere in the UI. 

[#punctuation]
== Do Not Use Punctuation - Except For Commas and Question Marks

Do not add any end punctuation to headings.
Do not add periods (.) or exclamation marks (!). 

=== Commas

Try to avoid adding commas (,), unless you need to list multiple items. 

Make sure to use the Oxford comma. 

=== Question Marks 

Use question marks (?) if a heading is a question. 

Phrase a heading as a question on xref:decision-dialogs.adoc[].
