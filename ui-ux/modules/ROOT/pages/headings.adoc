= Headings 

Headings mark off areas of xref:instruction-text.adoc[] or other components in the UI. 

To write headings in UI copy: 

* <<sentence,>>
* <<punctuation,>>

[#sentence]
== Use Sentence Case 

Write headings in sentence case.
Capitalize proper nouns or other terms that are capitalized elsewhere in the UI. 

[#punctuation]
== Do Not Use Punctuation - Except For Commas and Question Marks

Do not add any end punctuation to headings.
Do not add periods (.) or exclamation marks (!). 

Try to avoid adding commas (,), unless you need to list multiple items. 

Make sure to use the Oxford comma. 

Use question marks (?) if a heading is a question.
