= No Component Found Pages / Empty States

When the user hasn't yet created a database component, such as an index or a bucket, the UI should display a message stating *No <components> found*: 

image::NoComponentFound.png["The Search Service Data Tools. The user hasn't created a Search index or index alias yet, so two messages appear stating 'No search indexes found' and 'No index aliases found'.", align="center"]

Pluralize the component name and do not add a period at the end of "found."
