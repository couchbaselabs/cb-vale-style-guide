= Anchor Links

If you need to link to a specific place in a page, whether from another page or on the same page, use an anchor link. 

NOTE: Don't rely on Antora's automatically generated anchor links. 
If you need to use an anchor link, create your own. 
This prevents broken links if header content changes. 

When creating an anchor link:

* Keep the anchor link short and descriptive. 
Aim for no more than 3-5 words maximum.

For example, an anchor link for the heading *Generate API Keys* could be `[#generate-api-keys]`.
* Make sure that your anchor links are unique across the page. 
* Use the right anchor link style for the content you want to assign an anchor to: 
** For headers, full tables, lists, and other block elements: `[#anchor-link]`
** For table entries and other in-line text: `[[anchor-link]]`
* Use the right link style for your link: 
** For linking to an anchor from another page: `xref:name-of-page.adoc#anchor-link`
** For linking to an anchor on the same page: `\<<anchor-link,Link Text>>`
