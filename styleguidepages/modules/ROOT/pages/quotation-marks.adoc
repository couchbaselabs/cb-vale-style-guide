= Quotation Marks

Do not use quotation marks outside of inline code or code blocks. 

Use other emphasis options, such as xref:bold.adoc[] or xref:monospace-highlight.adoc[].

NOTE: When you're writing JSON, you will use quotation marks everywhere. Make sure to enclose your JSON in a code block or use xref:monospace-highlight.adoc[].
